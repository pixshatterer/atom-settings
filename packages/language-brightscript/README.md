# language-brightscript package

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to Brightscript files in Atom.

Originally converted from the Brightscript TextMate bundle and adapted with new features. The original textmate bundle can be found at <https://github.com/cmink/BrightScript.tmbundle>.

Has support for built-in Brightscript functions in both SDK1 and SDK2 [Scenegraph] (eg. findNode, toStr etc..)

Includes xml language bundle `XML-Roku` which includes snippets for Scenegraph including renderable nodes such as timer, rectangle, poster etc accessible by typing the name of the node you require and pressing `tab` - you can then tab between the pre-populated default values to quickly modify them.

A full list of snippets is available by viewing the settings page for this package within atom (`Preferences > Install > language-brightscript`)
