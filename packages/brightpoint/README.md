Brightpoint is an atom package to allow toggling breakpoints in Brightscript files by simply clicking on the line-number within the gutter.

Clicking a line-number with no breakpoint will add one, clicking a line-number with a breakpoint will remove it and clicking a line-number that is currently folded will unfold it - allowing you to then remove any breakpoints added within the collapsed block.

When a file is opened it will be scanned for existing breakpoints and they will be highlighted - and can then be removed by clicking on the gutter.
