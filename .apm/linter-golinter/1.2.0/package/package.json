In most cases it should be `$GOPATH/bin/golint`._\n\n[linter]: https://github.com/atom-community/linter\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"linter-golinter@1.2.0","_shasum":"cb888dd2986e1d56b4f2e45c97e9dc0a4a59e34e","_resolved":"file:../d-116312-73214-8sub87/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116312-73214-8sub87/package.tgz"}
